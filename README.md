# Vent
This is going to be an android app designed for venting

Project Scope:

- Users can add a new vent 
    - They get a textbox to enter
    - They can also place a marker on a map for where they want the vent to take place.
    - They can tag a vent
        - Tags consist of any singular adjective or verb from the dictionary

- Once a vent has been submitted, it is stored locally on the device, but the tags and the location provided by the user are sent to the cloud.
- Users can then see other people who have vented with a shared subset of tags within a given timeframe.
- Users can also pick a vent tag to send sympathy to. 
    - A targeted sympathy is when the user then selects a number of regions (which will be decided by dividing the map up evenly) For each region the app will then pick a random subset of vents (say 6). These vents' locations will be shown on the map and the user can pick one to send sympathy to. 
    - A tag sympathy is when a user provides sympathy to all users who have used a given tag.

- A user with their app open will be alerted if someone expresses sympathy with them.

- Users can lookup recent vents with tags on the map

-  A ranked list of tags (different metrics: most popular, up and coming, random order, search) can be seen

- Users can add or delete vents whenever. A deleted vent will have its location, tags and sympathy counters removed from the cloud.

Bonus Features:
- Different maps (not just the earth)
